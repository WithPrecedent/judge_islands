* Judges are not islands - For example, prior research has indicated that the decisions of federal Article III judges are dependent on, among other things, and to varying degrees:

  * Precedent (horizontal and vertical), which have different rules of deference

  * Written law in the form of statutes, rules, guidelines, and standards

  * Prior history of the case (which also create norms and rules of deference, which judges might honor to varying degrees)

  * Politics and public opinion

  * Their personal history (including, for example, the sex assigned at birth of their children) and demographics
  * Lawyers and parties in the case

  * Other judges

* It's this last point, interactions with other judges that the most significant finding in the last 20-30 years: so-called "panel effects"
  * The key findings: 
    * Judges on three-judge federal appellate panels do not vote independently (particularly in regard to dissents)
    * The ideology of co-panelists (as determined by the party of the appointing President) affects how a judge votes
  * Studies didn't always list the effect size of this finding, perhaps because it was very modest. Using my own data from Lexis, the estimated "panel effect" is very small (difference between : # Democrat panels and 2 panels as well as 3 Republican and 2 Republican panels): approximately .4 to .5 percentage points in criminal appeals
  * But this opened the door to new possibilities and methods for assessing interactions. As Josh Fischman has noted, when we say "panel effects," we are really describing a set of effects, some of which might offset each other. His study about hidden dissents is particularly important in understanding how ideology matters, even though 98-99% of federal appellate decisions are unanimous
* Taking a step back, you see all of the federal circuits and the incredible volume of interactions that may be tested
  * About a decade ago, I published a study, coincidentally in the Northwestern University Law Review, which found that including district judges (who had reviewed the same issues as the appellate panel) in panel effects showed much larger effects of ideology, deference, concurrences, and partisanship (which could be measured separately from ideology)
  * But that also just scratched the surface: the SCALES data, by including information from the "trenches" of federal litigation allows us to test 1000s of research questions that were previously unanswerable with prior data
  * All of those interactions I discussed at the beginning can now be examined - importantly, we can begin to study the federal judicial system as a "system" and not simply aggregate isolated cases at a single level. I've started by focusing on criminal cases, where I have been involved in the SCALES project for a while, but that's just a product of my interests and expertise
* SCALES is a game-changer and we are just beginning to appreciate what we can do with this data. My contribution to the symposium is focused on outlining the framework for measuring and analyzing interactions between judges and pretty much everything else using the SCALES data.
